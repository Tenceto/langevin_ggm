# Estimation of partially known Gaussian graphical models with score-based structural priors

This repository contains the official source code for the paper

**Estimation of partially known Gaussian graphical models with score-based structural priors** (AISTATS 2024),

*Authors: Mart√≠n Sevilla, Antonio G. Marques and  Santiago Segarra*

The code in `model` was taken from the [original repository](https://github.com/ermongroup/GraphScoreMatching) for the work **Permutation Invariant Graph Generation via Score-Based Generative Modeling** by Niu et al. (2020).

We propose a novel algorithm for the support estimation of partially known Gaussian graphical models that incorporates prior information about the underlying graph. 
In contrast to classical approaches that provide a *point estimate* based on a maximum likelihood or a maximum a posteriori criterion using (simple) priors *on the precision matrix*, we consider a prior *on the graph* and rely on annealed Langevin diffusion to generate *samples from the posterior distribution*.
Since the Langevin sampler requires access to the score function of the underlying graph prior, we use graph neural networks to effectively estimate the score from a graph dataset (either available beforehand or generated from a known distribution).

## Installation

**A Dockerfile is provided with all the commands necessary to run our algorithm and all the experiments from the paper.**

If a local installation is desired, the steps to follow are detailed below.

First, it is necessary to install `liblapack-dev` and `libopenblas-dev` to build the required Python package `skggm`.

`sudo apt install liblapack-dev libopenblas-dev`

Then all the Python dependencies can be installed.
We recommend installing them sequentially and not one by one, since `skggm` will return an error if `Cython` is not _previously_ installed in the machine.
Hence, there are two options:

1. Install everything in `requirements.txt` **except** `skggm`, and install this package later by simply running `pip install skggm`.
2. Or install the packages in `requirements.txt` sequentially by running the command `cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 pip install`

The package `skggm` is not compatible with the last version of `sklearn`, and thus some minor (manual) changes are necessary to make the code run without errors.
Within the `skggm` installation folder:
* In `inverse_covariance/quic_graph_lasso.py`, replace `sklearn.utils.testing` by `sklearn.utils._testing`
* In `inverse_covariance/quic_graph_lasso.py` and `inverse_covariance/model_average.py`, replace `sklearn.externals.joblib` by `joblib`

To reproduce the plots in the paper, some additional packages are necessary as we use TeX fonts.
The following line is **optional** and is only necessary to *exactly* reproduce the plots:

`apt install texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra dvipng cm-super`


## Running experiments

There are two executable Python scripts in this repository: one for partially known graphs, and another one for fully unknown graphs (see the last experiment in Section 4 of our paper).
All of them require two things:

1. A pre-trained EDP-GNN score network, which can be trained using its [original repository](https://github.com/ermongroup/GraphScoreMatching).
2. A tuned regularization for graphical lasso. 
In order to make comparisons fair, we tune the graphical lasso penalty for different types of graphs, different number of nodes, different number of missing values and different number of observations. 
In particular, we find a function of the number of observations for a fixed proportion of missing values, for each type of graph (see the Supplementary Material of our paper for more information).
The tuning can be done in `notebooks/tuning_glasso.ipynb`.

### Experiments with partially known graphs (`main.py`)
Just adapt the parameters of the simulation in a configuration file and run the script.
For example, to run our experiment using ego-nets, one would execute the following command:

`python main.py -c deezer`

The output can be analyzed in `notebooks/plot_results.ipynb` by plotting the metric curves.

### Experiments with fully unknown graphs(`main_bootstrap.py`)

This script covers the case in which the graph is fully unknown and it has to be estimated altogether.
Notice that in order to use this method, it is necessary to have a graphical lasso tuned beforehand to the specific simulation (i.e., with the whole graph being unknown for the corresponding type of graph prior).
The rest is the same as in `main.py`.
